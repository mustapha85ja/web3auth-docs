Web3Auth operates as a wallet infrastructure, providing enhanced flexibility and security for decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain
wallets. Throughout this documentation, we'll explore the functionality of Web3Auth, showcasing how it produces unique cryptographic key providers for
each user and application.

## High Level Architecture

The Web3Auth SDK lives solely on the user/application’s front-end client and handles the interactions between OAuth providers and the Auth Network.

This diagram below, describes the relationship between the Web3Auth SDKs and integrating application. It also depicts the difference between the
products Web3Auth offers, to enable a developer friendly integration of this infrastructure.

A Web3Auth Plug and Play integration process is designed to be developer-friendly, requiring only the initialization of the Web3Auth SDKs and the set up of necessary
configurations. Once integrated into your application, the SDK facilitates the embedding of the login function. This allows developers to utilize the
SDK to authenticate users by invoking the connect function, which can be activated via a login button or any user-triggered event.

Once the user starts the process:

1. User is redirected to our portal (`app.openlogin.com`)
2. Our portal, `app.openlogin.com`, then handles the initial process of login
3. User is redirected to login/OAuth provider and carries out the authentication process with respect to their auth provider
4. User is redirected back to our portal, which then handles the reconstruction of the user’s key
5. Finally, once the user is successfully authenticated, they are redirected back to application, with derived key specific to the application/wallet

##### Here's a diagram showing this process:

The Core Kit SDKs serve as the backbone of the Web3Auth Plug n Play (PnP) SDKs. They form the essence of the Web3Auth infrastructure and allow for
direct usage within decentralized applications (dApps) to foster deeper integration.

An integral part of this infrastructure is the tKey SDK, the foundational SDK utilized for the implementation of Web3Auth PnP and Core-Kit.

With the Web3Auth infrastructure, your key is divided into multiple parts and stored across your devices and our Auth Network. This ensures that your
key is always available and never stored in a single place. While in the traditional Web3Auth SDK, your key was dynamically reconstructed in the
frontend using threshold signatures.

With the new Web3Auth MPC (Multi Party Computation) architecture, it is **never reconstructed**. Instead, these partial keys are stored across
different locations, and your device is used to make partial signatures for your message/ transaction. These are finally returned to the frontend
where using TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme), these signatures are combined to make a final signature. You can use this finally signed
message/transaction to make a transaction on the blockchain.

The Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) is a cryptographic primitive for distributed key generation and signing. The use of TSS in Web3Auth's Auth
network is a new paradigm that can provide numerous benefits, especially in terms of security.

As you can notice in this diagram above, the final output, i.e., the User's TSS Account, is generated in multiple stages within the infrastructure.
Since this is a TSS- MPC based infrastructure, you don't get back a private key, but signatures that can be used to make transactions on the
blockchain.

## Web3Auth Key Management

Web3Auth's [Key Management Infrastructure](/infrastructure/key-management/) enhances security by distributing a user's private key across various key
shares, thereby avoiding direct exposure of seed phrases. These key shares form a 'web of trust' and enable key management akin to multi-factor
account handling. Users employ OAuth logins, trusted devices, and other factors to manage their cryptographic key pairs. Importantly, the complete
private keys are not stored anywhere within the Key Infrastructure system, including our databases or any participating nodes.

The process is illustrated below using Threshold Cryptography principles. In this system, users only need a minimum of 2 out of n key shares to either
retrieve their private key _(in the non-MPC version)_ or generate transaction signatures _(in the MPC version)_. This design empowers users with
control over their keys while also eliminating the risk of account loss due to a single point of failure. For instance, a user could lose their device
yet still retain access to their account.

To create a social login share, users interact with the Web3Auth Auth Network, where key generation operates via a 5/9 consensus system. This setup
guarantees that keys remain non-custodial, ensuring that neither Web3Auth, Social Login Providers, nor any other party holding a key share can claim
full ownership.

:::tip managing keys

For managing keys, our infrastructure uses various cryptographic techniques such as Shamir's Secret Sharing, Threshold Cryptography, and Multi Party
Computation. To know more about how we manage keys, please refer to our
[Key Management and Security of our Infrastructure](/infrastructure/key-management).
