The Web3Auth [Key Management Infrastructure](./key-management) eliminates the exposure of seed phrases to users by splitting up the private key into
different key shares representing a user's web of trust. The diagram shows below how user's private key is being split up. Using the concept of
Threshold Cryptography (with Shamir Secret Sharing), users only need a minimum of 2 out of nth number of keyshares to get back their private key. This
allow users to have control over their key and at the same time prevent account loss from a single point of failure (ie, they can lose their device
and still have access to their account). Further to create a social login share, a user has to use the Web3Auth Auth Network, where the key generation
happens through a 5/9 consensus system. This ensures that the keys are always non custodial to Web3Auth, Social Login Providers or any other party
holding a key share.
